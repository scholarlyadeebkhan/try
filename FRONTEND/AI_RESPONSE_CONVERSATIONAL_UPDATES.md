### 5. **Fallback Responses Made Casual**

**AI Analysis Fallback:**

- **After**: "Got your AI results! Can you tell me how you're feeling? Any symptoms I should know about?"

## Expected Results

### **Before (Formal Doctor Style):**
```
"I understand you're experiencing a headache. That must be quite concerning for you.

To help me better understand your situation, I'd like to ask a few questions:

1. When exactly did these symptoms start?
2. Have you experienced anything like this before?
3. What have you eaten in the last 24-48 hours?
4. On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate your discomfort?
5. Does anything seem to make it better or worse?

Based on what you've described so far, tension headaches are common and can be caused by stress, dehydration, or poor sleep.

I recommend staying hydrated, getting adequate rest, and if symptoms persist or worsen, please consult with a healthcare professional for a proper examination and diagnosis."
```

### **After (Conversational Friend Style):**
```
"That headache sounds rough! When did it start and what's the pain level (1-10)? Try drinking water and resting - if it doesn't improve in a day or gets worse, definitely see a doctor."
```

## Impact on User Experience

‚úÖ **Faster Reading**: Responses are 60-70% shorter
